   About this page
   Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network.
   This page checks to see if it's really you sending the requests, and
   not a robot. [1]Why did this happen?
   This page appears when Google automatically detects requests coming
   from your computer network which appear to be in violation of the
   [2]Terms of Service. The block will expire shortly after those requests
   stop. In the meantime, solving the above CAPTCHA will let you continue
   to use our services.
   This traffic may have been sent by malicious software, a browser
   plug-in, or a script that sends automated requests. If you share your
   network connection, ask your administrator for help â€” a different
   computer using the same IP address may be responsible. [3]Learn more
   Sometimes you may be asked to solve the CAPTCHA if you are using
   advanced terms that robots are known to use, or sending requests very
   quickly.
